• **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned and preprocessed the acquired data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

• **Data Transformation & Data Modeling:** I transformed the raw data into a structured format, as well as I created relationships between various tables in order to connect them with each other making it ready for in-depth analysis.

• **Dashboard Creation:** I created dashboards that effectively communicated critical insights to stakeholders. These dashboards were designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy interpretation of complex cricket statistics.
